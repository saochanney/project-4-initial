One of the first things that I wanted to do
for this project, that I usually do for 
most of my projects, is to read the prompt
and what I am being asked, and I usually let that
soak in my brain for a day, up to a few days.

When I feel I am ready, I have started writing my
AI prompts. I have the assignment side by side and
I make sure that I am being clear and concise about
what I am asking of the AI.

I usually go through the prompts one at a time, 
write down what I am asking for either on my ipad
or on a google doc. This time I was able to use
the AI interaction log to write down all the things
and attempts at prompts. 

I am at a point now where I have generated the code
with the AI, and I now need to go through all the 
lines of code to make sure that there are no errors
and nothing needs to be adjusted manually.

Before I go through all the code, if one of the
requirements are to make sure that the code can run
successfully, I run everything to make sure that it
compiles first. If there are any errors, then I will 
address those first to make sure everything works so far.

(At this point, everything has compiled.)
